GoboLight
=========

An ultra-simple backlight tool. Currently supports Linux.

Requirements
------------

* Linux with a backlight driver that supports `/sys/class/backlight`.

Usage
-----

### GUI

There is a systray-style widget for Awesome WM: [gobo-awesome-light](https://github.com/gobolinux/gobo-awesome-light)

### Command-line

The interface is via a simple command-line client, inspired by `xbacklight`:

* `gobolight` - Displays current brightness on a scale from 0 to 100
* `gobolight <n>` - Set brightness to `n` on a scale from 0 to 100. 0 means "display off"; 100 means "full brightness".
* `gobolight -inc <n>` - Increase brightness by `n`, capping at 100 (full brightness).
* `gobolight -dec <n>` - Decrease brightness by `n`, capping at 0 (display off).
